PostedNotes serves as an ethical note sharing platform for users (students) to share notes as per permission of their instructors. In the modern note sharing, notes can cost to from $20 to about $40, which is very expensive. Also, it is illegal as a 
student's notes is technically a course instructor's intellectual property, although it is rarely enforced due to how widespread and difficult it is to enforce.

By using PostedNotes, students who download these notes for a one time fee (usually between $1~$5), can study for their next semester's courseworks at a lower cost or study for the final.
It encourages sellers (students) to write good notes to get good ratings, which translates into higher probability of their notes being downloaded. Each course platform is granted after a written permission 
(via email) is received from the course instructor. Additionally, course instructors can charge a pecentage (ranging from 0%-20%) commission depending on each user posting notes under their course.
A 5% commission is given on behalf of the development team to further develop the platform. To follow Academic Honesty, the platform is monitored daily to make sure no exam materials or instructor's 
notes are posted. The notes must be purely handwritten by students and uploaded as jpg or png. 

The Development of this project is currently funded by CreateX and is in its prototyping stage.
